                <li>249,000,000 people were diagnosed with Malaria in 2022 according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Of those, 608,000 died, mostly children.</li>
                <li>The malarious mosquitoes live in tropical places such as in the Southern Hemisphere therefore, Malaria is one of the biggest health concerns in Africa, Southern Asia, Central America and South America.</li>
                <li>The African region is home to 94% of malaria cases as well as 95% of all Malaria deaths.</li>
                <li>There are 3,500 known species of mosquitoes. About 10% of all mosquitoes
                    have the parasite that spreads malaria. Therefore, there are 350 species of
                    mosquitoes that can transmit the disease. However, only females of the genus
                    Anopheles transmit the disease.</li>

                <li>Complications of malaria include: brain complications, breathing problems,
                    organ failure, and hypoglycemia.</li>
                <li>Early diagnosis and treatment are critical.</li>
                <li>People traveling to areas where malaria is common typically take protective
                    drugs before, during, and after their trip. Treatment includes antimalarial drugs.</li>
                <li>Current malaria vaccines reduce the chances of getting malaria by 75% after
                    receiving 3 doses.</li>
                <li>Recently 2 vaccines were approved by the World Health Organization (WHO),
                    these are RTS,S and R21.</li>
                <li>The use of RTS,S and R21 have resulted in a drop in hospitalizations and
                    deaths from malaria.</li>

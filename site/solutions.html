                <li>There are many measures currently in place to prevent the spread of malaria
                    including: insect repellent, rapid diagnostic tests, effective medications,
                    access to treatment, wearing clothing treated with solutions to prevent
                    mosquito bites, and sleeping under netting.</li>
                <li>Education is key in decreasing the effects of the disease; therefore, I created
                    this website and a pamphlet to help bring awareness to this.</li>
                <li>Many organizations and educational institutions are doing research on the
                    prevention and treatment of malaria. For those able to contribute, I have
                    provided a link to Columbia Universityâ€™s Department of Infectious Disease,
                    so that funding can be directed to malaria research.</li>

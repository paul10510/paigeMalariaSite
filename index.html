            <h1>What is Malaria?</h1>
            <p>Malaria is a disease caused by a plasmodium parasite, transmitted by the bite of infected mosquitoes. The severity of malaria varies based on the species of plasmodium. Symptoms are chills, fever, and sweating, usually occurring a few weeks after being bitten. People traveling to areas where malaria is common typically take protective drugs before, during, and after their trip. Treatment includes antimalarial drugs.</p>

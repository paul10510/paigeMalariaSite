            <h2>Where is home for Malaria?</h2>
            <p>According to the CDC, Malaria is not frequently seen in the United States, however, it is extremely common in South Africa.  According to the Vector Disease Control International, more than ½ the population of the world lives in areas at risk for Malaria.  The Malarious mosquitoes live in tropical places such as in the Southern Hemisphere and it is one of the biggest health concerns in Africa, Southern Asia, Central America and South America. Since this is such a big issue in Africa, I would like to discuss the issue of Malaria in Africa.</p>

            <h2>Why Malaria?</h2>
            <p>Malaria is most prominent in Africa however it can also be found in Central and South America. If you have ever been to these places or have learned about them, you’ve heard about their very hot and humid climate. Although I have never been, I know people who have been to these places and described the climate as very hot and sticky. Climates of that type are host to the 10% of the mosquitoes that carry malaria.</p>

            <h2>Causes of Malaria</h2>
            <p>The Yaounde Cameroon Declaration identified a number of root causes that need to be addressed in order to help eradicate malaria.  These include, “changing ecology and vector behavior; low access to and insufficient quality of health services, including gender-related and financial barriers within households; a global economic downturn and inadequate domestic funding;  climate change; and biological threats such as insecticide and drug resistance as well as emerging malaria vectors.”</p>

            <h2>Prevention</h2>
            <p>Of the 240 Million people globally who were diagnosed with Malaria in 2020, 620,000 died (80% of whom were children under 5) with most instances of Malarial disease occurring in Sub-Saharian Africa. Although in Sub-Saharan Africa, Malaria is a very common, it is spread unevenly throughout the Southern Hemisphere. If any of you have ever been to somewhere in Africa or Central America, you might have stopped by your doctor to get something called a Malaria vaccine. According to the University of Maryland, the malaria vaccine consists of a parasite called Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite. Scientists have been trying to make a vaccine that prevents Malaria for years but success has been limited. What the current vaccine does is it reduces your chances of getting malaria by 75% after receiving 3 doses. Although the vaccine is somewhat effective, it is not accessible to everyone. Especially in Africa where it’s needed most.</p>

            <p>There are many measures that can be used to prevent the spread of malaria.  These include using EPA registered insect repellant,rapid diagnostic tests, effective medications, access to treatment, wearing long sleeve shirts and long pants. Treating clothing and gear with permethrin (the scientific name for bug spray), and sleeping under mosquito nets.</p>

            <h2>My Solution</h2>
            <span>My contribution to the prevention and treatment of Malaria is education. This will be accomplished by creating this website and a pamphlet, to be used by those without the technology to view this website. Additional funding is needed to help this cause. Therefore I have included a link to Columbia University Infectious Diseases Research. (<a href="https://infectiousdiseases.cuimc.columbia.edu/research/research-areas/malaria">https://infectiousdiseases.cuimc.columbia.edu/research/research-areas/malaria</a>) for those who are able to contribute to this worthy cause.</span>

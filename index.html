            <h1>What is Malaria?</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Malaria is a disease caused by a plasmodium parasite, transmitted by the bite of infected mosquitoes. The severity of malaria varies based on the species of plasmodium. Symptoms are chills, fever, and sweating, usually occurring a few weeks after being bitten. People traveling to areas where malaria is common typically take protective drugs before, during, and after their trip. Treatment includes antimalarial drugs.</li>
                <li>249,000,000 people were diagnosed with Malaria in 2022 according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Of those, 608,000 died, mostly children.</li>
                <li>According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Malaria is not frequently seen in the United States, however, it is extremely common in South Africa.</li>
                <li>The Malarious mosquitoes live in tropical places such as in the Southern Hemisphere therefore, Malaria is one of the biggest health concerns in Africa, Southern Asia, Central America and South America. The African region is home to 94% of malaria cases as well as 95% of all Malaria deaths.</li>
                <li>Malaria mostly spreads to people through the bites of some infected female Anopheles mosquitoes.</li>
            </ul>
